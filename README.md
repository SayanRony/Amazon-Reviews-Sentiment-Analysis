# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop a Streamlit app capable of analyzing sentiments in various scenarios, including single-line reviews, multiple reviews from CSV files, and product reviews from Amazon URLs.


## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - A logistic regression model is initially trained for sentiment prediction.
  - Future plans include experimenting with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to compare accuracy and performance.
- **Interactive User Interface**: 
  - Develop an easy-to-use UI to display sentiment predictions for stakeholders.
- **Advanced NLP Models**:
  - Explore sophisticated natural language processing models to handle complex sentiments, such as sarcasm.

## Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Input text is cleaned (e.g., stopword removal, punctuation cleaning).
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Text is converted into numerical features using a TF-IDF vectorizer.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a logistic regression model for prediction.
4. **Prediction**:
   - Predict sentiment based on the processed text.
5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Experiment with advanced models and improve the system for nuanced sentiment analysis.

## Future Plans
- Experiment with different machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Enhance the UI for better interactivity and stakeholder engagement.  
- Integrate state-of-the-art NLP models to handle complex linguistic phenomena like sarcasm.
